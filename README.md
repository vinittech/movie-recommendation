# Movie Recommendation System using Auto-Encoders

####  Markup : * Project Description 
This project proposes an auto-encoder approach for producing a collaborative filtering system which
predicts movie ratings for a user based on what other similar users have rated. Using the Movie-Lens
1 million dataset, we explore the use of auto-encoder for predicting usersâ€™ ratings on unseen movies,
thereby enabling recommendation of movies. To verify and evaluate our approach, we compare our
approach to standard collaborative filtering technique like Spark ALS matrix-factorization.
