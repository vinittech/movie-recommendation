# Movie Recommendation System using Auto-Encoders

####  - Project Description 
This project proposes an auto-encoder approach for producing a collaborative filtering system which
predicts movie ratings for a user based on what other similar users have rated. Using the Movie-Lens
1 million dataset, we explore the use of auto-encoder for predicting users’ ratings on unseen movies,
thereby enabling recommendation of movies. To verify and evaluate our approach, we compare our
approach to standard collaborative filtering technique like Spark ALS matrix-factorization.
